```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
smaller <- diamonds |> 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller |> 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

## Results Review^[Reviewing the results of the data above]
*    As the Number of "carats" increased the "Count" would decrease.
